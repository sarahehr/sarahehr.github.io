<h1> About Me </h1>
<br>
<p><img src="AboutMe.jpg" style="float:left" width="375" height="500"></p>
<p> My name is Sarah Ehrlich. I'm a journalism and agricultural education student at Colorado State.
Born and raised in Colorado, I am currently residing in Fort Collins, CO, but I call the San Luis Valley of Southern Colorado my first home. </p>
<p>My first interest in photography came to the surface after taking a digital photography class in high school, and after my parents bought the family a Canon Rebel T3i. I adopted the camera and brought it with me to college, and she continues to be my main weapon of choice, until I can afford new lenses, cameras, etc. </p>
<p>This portfolio also includes some writing samples from my time as an arts and culture reporter at the Rocky Mountain Collegian. 
I will graduate in the fall of 2018 with a degree in journalism with a minor in agricultural education. I hope my future career endeavors include education and outreach opportunities about agriculture, science and the arts.</p>
